# Security Policy

Trousseau Project will appreciate any feedback about security concerns and vulnerabilities.
As Trousseau is about Secrets Management, reporting a concern or vulnerabilities has to be discoved in a 
responsible way to avoid potential exploit of any existing flaws.

Please send us first your report via email at security@trousseau.io with the following standard bug template:

* Title

* Current behavior
* Expected behavior
* Relevant logs
* Other comment

Once analyze, confirm, and find a mitigation together, we will oepn an issue and a security advisory within the project 
to track the resolution and merge to the master branch.
