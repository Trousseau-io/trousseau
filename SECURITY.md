# Security Policy

Trousseau Project will appreciate any feedback about security concerns and vulnerabilities.

As Trousseau is about Secrets Management, reporting a concern or vulnerabilities has to be disclosed in a 
responsible way to avoid potential exploit of any existing flaws.

Please send us first your report via email at security@trousseau.io with the following standard bug template:

* Describe the bug
  * A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
* To reproduce
  * Steps to reproduce the security issue or the proof-of-concept theory.
  * Resulting behavior.
* Expected behavior
  * A clear and concise description of what is expected to happen.
* Relevant logs
  * Add logs to help explain the problem.
* Environment details
  * A clear and concise list of software used along with Trousseau and their versions.
* Additional context 
  * Add any other context about the problem here
* Report by (github nickname)

Once we have worked together to analyze, confirm, and find a mitigation, we will open a security advisory within the project to track the resolution and merge to the master branch.

Thank you for helping to make Secrets safe! #sharingiscaring
